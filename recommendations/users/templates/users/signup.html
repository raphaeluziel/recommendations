    <p>If you're just here to see the questions, here they are:</p>
    <div id="questions">
      <p>
        To make my letter a great letter, remind me about specific things you did that made you stand out. Do not include things I already know like “I participated a lot” or “I did well on tests” or “I always did my homework”. <b>One specific anecdote (story) you tell me is worth a hundred general statements!</b>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Describe any class demonstrations you may have participated in. What was your role?</li>
        <li>Are there any interesting questions you remember asking in class, or after class? Be specific.</li>
        <li>Was there something, a concept, that you learned in class that you put to use, or observed in your life and activities outside of class. Again, be specific.</li>
        <li>Were there any science extracurricular activities you participated in while in high school? Is there a program you will be attending this summer? Be specific with the name and dates of the program.</li>
        <li>If you already have a good idea as to what you want to study in college, or a career goal for the future, let me know what it is, and how sure you are of this. It's okay to put undecided, or multiple answers.</li>
        <li>Is there any work (perhaps with my comments) that you would like to upload that demonstrates the quality of your work? If so, take a photo or upload from your device using the button below (Maximum File Size is 10 MB).</li>
        <li>Is there anything else you think made you stand out that was not addressed in the previous questions? If so tell me!</li>
      </ol>
